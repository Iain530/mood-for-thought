##### Log list

This view will contain all logs as a scrollable list. A log will have it's own container. Within this container the following information will be shown:

  - Time (at which log was created)
  - Mood
  - Activities (if any)

Logs will be ordered chronologically, with the most recent log at the top of the list. Logs can be filtered by mood and by activity.

##### Calendar

This view will show one month at a time in a traditional calendar layout. Each day of the month will have it's own square. This square will be coloured based on the moods logged that day. If n logs are made on the same day then that days square will be divided into n pieces. These pieces each represent a log on that day and will be coloured by that logs mood.

When a day on the calendar is selected, it's details appear below the calendar. This would be the time of logs, the step count for that day, the sleep information, and the activities taken part in that day.

##### Stats

This view will contain a radar chart with each mood as a point on the edge of the radar. This chart will display information on averages of moods across days. If a mood on the chart is selected then information about how often this mood is logged and the activities most commonly logged alongside this mood will be shown below the chart.

##### Activities

This view will list all activities in an expandable list. The activity's name and icon will be shown, and when selected the list will expand to show more about the activity.

Displayed within the expansion will be:
  - the description of the activity
  - the number of times the activity has been logged
  - the number of times the activity has been logged alongside each mood
  - options to edit or delete the activity

The user will also be able to add new activities through this view.
